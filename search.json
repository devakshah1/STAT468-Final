    "text": "The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between OHL performance / player build and NHL career longevity. We will analyze how various factors such as goals per game, assists per game, height, and weight influence the probability of a player playing more than 200 games in the NHL.\nCHAPTER 1: IMPORT\nThe first step in our project is to import the necessary libraries and data:\n\nimport TopDownHockey_Scraper.TopDownHockey_NHL_Scraper as tdhnhlscrape\nimport TopDownHockey_Scraper.TopDownHockey_EliteProspects_Scraper as tdhepscrape\nfrom nhlpy import NHLClient\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import date\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom lets_plot import *\nLetsPlot.setup_html()\n\n\n            \n            \n            \n\n\nWe will create a toggle to see if we want to rescrape the data or just import the prior scrape from an existing file. If scrape is set to True, we will scrape the data; otherwise, we will read from the existing file.\n\nscrape = False # Set to True to scrape data, False to use existing data\n\n#This will be the file name where data is stored in our git repo\nfilename = \"regression_input.xlsx\"\n\nFirst, we loop through a bunch of seasons and scrape player OHL stats and builds. Not that we get rid of player positions so that we can join with player builds using names as index. While this is mixing some of steps 2&3 (Tidy&Transform), it’s easier to do it here since we want to get the player builds at the time of the draft, and it would be confusing to do the join later on, when we’re outside the loop and the stats&builds may not correspond to one another since they could be from seperate years.\n\n#Get OHL Player Data (stats, build, etc)\n\nif scrape == True:\n\n    #Can't include all years because of backend API issues in some years\n    years = [\"2004-2005\", \"2006-2007\", \"2007-2008\", \"2008-2009\", \"2009-2010\", \"2010-2011\", \"2011-2012\", \"2012-2013\", \"2013-2014\", \n            \"2014-2015\", \"2015-2016\", \"2016-2017\", \"2017-2018\", \"2018-2019\"]\n\n    aggregated_output = pd.DataFrame()\n\n    for year in years:\n        df = tdhepscrape.get_skaters((\"ohl\"), (year))\n\n        #GET PLAYER INFO\n        info = tdhepscrape.get_player_information(df)\n\n        #GET RID OF PLAYER POSITIONS FROM NAMES\n        df['player'] = df['player'].str.replace(r'\\s*\\([^)]*\\)', '', regex=True)\n\n        #ADD YEAR TO DF\n        df.insert(0, \"year\", year)\n\n        #JOIN PLAYER BIO WITH STATS\n        year_output = pd.merge(df[[\"year\", \"player\", \"gp\", \"g\", \"a\", \"tp\"]], info[[\"player\", \"dob\", \"height\", \"weight\", \"shoots\"]], on='player', how='inner')\n\n        #ADD CURRENT YEAR PROSPECTS TO AGGREGATED DF\n        aggregated_output = pd.concat([aggregated_output, year_output])\n\nYour scrape request is skater data from the following league:\nohl\nIn the following season:\n2004-2005\nBeginning scrape of ohl skater data from 2004-2005.\nSuccessfully scraped all ohl skater data from 2004-2005.\nScraping ohl data is complete.
