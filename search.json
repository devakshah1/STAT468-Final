    "text": "The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between OHL performance / player build and NHL career longevity. We will analyze how various factors such as goals per game, assists per game, height, and weight influence the probability of a player playing more than 200 games in the NHL.\nCHAPTER 1: IMPORT\nThe first step in our project is to import the necessary libraries and data:\n\nimport TopDownHockey_Scraper.TopDownHockey_NHL_Scraper as tdhnhlscrape\nimport TopDownHockey_Scraper.TopDownHockey_EliteProspects_Scraper as tdhepscrape\nfrom nhlpy import NHLClient\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import date\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom lets_plot import *\nLetsPlot.setup_html()\nfrom pins import board_s3\nfrom vetiver import vetiver_pin_write\nfrom vetiver import VetiverModel\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom vetiver.handlers.base import BaseHandler\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n\n            \n            \n            \n\n\nWe will create a toggle to see if we want to rescrape the data or just import the prior scrape from an existing file. If scrape is set to True, we will scrape the data; otherwise, we will read from the existing file.\n\nscrape = False # Set to True to scrape data, False to use existing data\n\n#This will be the file name where data is stored in our git repo\nfilename = \"regression_input.xlsx\"\n\nFirst, we loop through a bunch of seasons and scrape player OHL stats and builds. Note that we get rid of player positions so that we can join with player builds using names as index. While this is mixing some of steps 2&3 (Tidy&Transform), it’s easier to do it here since we want to get the player builds at the time of the draft, and it would be confusing to do the join later on, when we’re outside the loop and the stats&builds may not correspond to one another since they could be from seperate years.\n\n#Get OHL Player Data (stats, build, etc)\n\nif scrape == True:\n\n    #Can't include all years because of backend API issues in some years\n    years = [\"2004-2005\", \"2006-2007\", \"2007-2008\", \"2008-2009\", \"2009-2010\", \"2010-2011\", \"2011-2012\", \"2012-2013\", \"2013-2014\", \n             \"2014-2015\", \"2015-2016\", \"2016-2017\", \"2017-2018\", \"2018-2019\"]\n\n    aggregated_output = pd.DataFrame()\n\n    for year in years:\n        df = tdhepscrape.get_skaters((\"ohl\"), (year))\n\n        #GET PLAYER INFO\n        info = tdhepscrape.get_player_information(df)\n\n        #GET RID OF DEFENCEMEN\n        df = df[~df['player'].str.contains(r'\\(([^)]*D[^)]*)\\)', regex=True)]\n\n        #GET RID OF PLAYER POSITIONS FROM NAMES\n        df['player'] = df['player'].str.replace(r'\\s*\\([^)]*\\)', '', regex=True)\n\n        #ADD YEAR TO DF\n        df.insert(0, \"year\", year)\n\n        #JOIN PLAYER BIO WITH STATS\n        year_output = pd.merge(df[[\"year\", \"player\", \"gp\", \"g\", \"a\", \"tp\"]], info[[\"player\", \"dob\", \"height\", \"weight\", \"shoots\"]], on='player', how='inner')\n\n        #ADD CURRENT YEAR PROSPECTS TO AGGREGATED DF\n        aggregated_output = pd.concat([aggregated_output, year_output])\nelse:\n    print(\"Scrape completed prior\")\n\nNext, we print the draftyears of all NHL players drafted between 2005 and 2020\n\nif scrape == True:\n    years = list(range(2005, 2021))\n\n    draftyears = pd.DataFrame()\n\n    for year in years:\n        df_list = pd.read_html(f\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_{year}_entry.html\", match=\"Round\")\n\n        players_drafted = df_list[0]\n\n        players_drafted\n\n        #Let's get rid of the top header that isnt really used\n        players_drafted.columns = players_drafted.columns.get_level_values(1)\n\n        players_drafted[\"draft_year\"] = year\n        players_drafted = players_drafted[[\"draft_year\", \"Player\"]]\n        players_drafted =players_drafted.rename(columns={\"draft_year\": \"player_draft_year\", \"Player\": \"player\"})\n        draftyears = pd.concat([draftyears, players_drafted])\n\n    print(draftyears)        \n\nFinally, we get the games played for all NHL players to have played at least 1 game in the NHL. We will use this to calculate the probability of a player playing more than 200 games in the NHL.\n\n#Getting games played for all NHL players\nif scrape == True:\n    nhl_gp = pd.DataFrame()\n    pages = list(range(1, 80))\n\n    for page in pages:\n        df_list = pd.read_html(f\"https://www.eliteprospects.com/league/nhl/stats/all-time?page={page}\")\n        page_stats = df_list[2]\n        page_stats = page_stats[[\"Player\", \"GP\"]]\n        nhl_gp = pd.concat([nhl_gp, page_stats])\n\n    nhl_gp = nhl_gp.rename(columns={\"Player\": \"player\", \"GP\": \"nhl_gp\"})\n\n    #GET RID OF PLAYER POSITIONS FROM NAMES\n    nhl_gp['player'] = nhl_gp['player'].str.replace(r'\\s*\\([^)]*\\)', '', regex=True)\n\n    # Replacing NA and \"-\" values with 0\n    nhl_gp[\"nhl_gp\"] = nhl_gp[\"nhl_gp\"].fillna(0)\n    nhl_gp[\"nhl_gp\"] = nhl_gp[\"nhl_gp\"].replace(\"-\", 0)\n\n    nhl_gp\n\nCHAPTER 2: TIDY\nNext, we change the type of some columns - they are objects by default, we need them to be integeres to regress on them later on. We also replace “-” values with 0 for regression purposes, since “-” means that the player did not play in that season, and we want to treat that as 0 games played.\n\nif scrape == True:\n    aggregated_output[\"gp\"] = aggregated_output[\"gp\"].replace(\"-\", 0)\n    aggregated_output[\"gp\"] = aggregated_output[\"gp\"].astype(int)\n    aggregated_output[\"g\"] = aggregated_output[\"g\"].replace(\"-\", 0)\n    aggregated_output[\"g\"] = aggregated_output[\"g\"].astype(int)\n    aggregated_output[\"a\"] = aggregated_output[\"a\"].replace(\"-\", 0)\n    aggregated_output[\"a\"] = aggregated_output[\"a\"].astype(int)\n    aggregated_output[\"tp\"] = aggregated_output[\"tp\"].replace(\"-\", 0)\n    aggregated_output[\"tp\"] = aggregated_output[\"tp\"].astype(int)\n\nGet corresponding draft year for each row in the dataset (oe. season 2024-2025 would have a draft year of 2025).\nNote this isn’t necessarily the players’ draft year - it’s just the draft year for the corresponding row’s season.

What would happen if we changed the threshold for a positive to a value that isn;t 0.5? We can test this using a ROC curve. The ROC curve shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at different thresholds. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a single number that summarizes the performance of the model across all thresholds.\nWe will also use ROC curve to look at the TPR, FPR of different thresholds. We can calculate AUR from this to measure accuracy of model considering all thresholds (AUS = 1 means perfect model, AUS = 0.5 means random guessing).:\n\n# True labels and predicted probabilities\ny_true = df_test[\"Pr[GP &gt; 200]\"]\ny_score = result.predict(X)\n\n# Compute ROC curve and AUC\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_score)\nroc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)\n\n# Plot ROC curve\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (AUC = {roc_auc:.2f})')\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')\nplt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])\nplt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])\nplt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\nplt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\nplt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')\nplt.legend(loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn AUC of 0.7 is significantly better than random guessing. We see that our model does a pretty good job at predicting full-time NHL career probability based on OHL performance and player build.\nSTORING MODEL IN AWS S3 BUCKET\nThe code below will store the model in an AWS S3 bucket.
